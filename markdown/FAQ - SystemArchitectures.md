## Scalability

### Q: When should I consider horizontal vs. vertical scaling?
**A:** The choice between horizontal and vertical scaling depends on several factors:

Vertical Scaling is better when:
- Your application is monolithic and difficult to partition
- You need stronger consistency guarantees
- Your data size fits comfortably in a single machine
- You need to minimize latency

Horizontal Scaling is better when:
- You need unlimited scaling potential
- You want better fault tolerance
- Your workload can be easily partitioned
- Cost optimization is a priority

### Q: How do I handle database scaling bottlenecks?
**A:** Database scaling can be approached through several strategies:

1. Read Replicas:
   - For read-heavy workloads
   - Improves read performance
   - Provides failover capability

2. Sharding:
   - For write-heavy workloads
   - Distributes data across multiple databases
   - Requires careful partition key selection

3. Caching:
   - For frequently accessed data
   - Reduces database load
   - Requires cache invalidation strategy

## High Availability

### Q: What's the difference between failover and fault tolerance?
**A:** 
Failover:
- Switches to backup system when primary fails
- Usually involves downtime
- Simpler to implement
- Example: Primary-Secondary database setup

Fault Tolerance:
- Continues operating when components fail
- No downtime
- More complex to implement
- Example: Distributed database with no single point of failure

### Q: How do I design for the "right" level of availability?
**A:** Consider:

1. Business Requirements:
   - Critical systems: 99.999% (5 minutes downtime/year)
   - Business applications: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
   - Non-critical systems: 99% (3.65 days downtime/year)

2. Cost Implications:
   - Each nine (9) in the decimal adds significant cost
   - Consider business impact of downtime
   - Balance cost vs. benefit

## Performance

### Q: What are the most common performance bottlenecks?
**A:** Common bottlenecks include:

1. Database:
   - Poor query optimization
   - Lack of proper indexing
   - Connection pool exhaustion

2. Network:
   - High latency
   - Limited bandwidth
   - Too many round trips

3. Application:
   - Memory leaks
   - Thread contention
   - Inefficient algorithms

### Q: How do I approach performance optimization?
**A:** Follow this systematic approach:

1. Measure:
   - Establish baselines
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Use proper monitoring tools

2. Analyze:
   - Review metrics
   - Profile code
   - Check resource utilization

3. Improve:
   - Make one change at a time
   - Validate improvements
   - Document changes

## Data Management

### Q: How do I choose between SQL and NoSQL databases?
**A:** Consider these factors:

SQL when you need:
- Strong consistency
- Complex queries
- ACID transactions
- Structured data

NoSQL when you need:
- Flexible schema
- High scalability
- Better performance at scale
- Simpler horizontal scaling

### Q: What are the best practices for data partitioning?
**A:** Key considerations include:

1. Partition Key Selection:
   - Even distribution
   - Minimal cross-partition queries
   - Business query patterns

2. Partitioning Strategy:
   - Range partitioning
   - Hash partitioning
   - Composite partitioning

## Microservices

### Q: When should I use microservices architecture?
**A:** Consider microservices when:

Advantages:
- Independent scaling needed
- Team autonomy is important
- Different technology stacks required
- Complex domain with clear boundaries

Challenges:
- Distributed system complexity
- Service coordination
- Data consistency
- Operational overhead

### Q: How do I handle distributed transactions in microservices?
**A:** Common approaches:

1. Saga Pattern:
   - Sequence of local transactions
   - Compensating transactions for rollback
   - Event-driven coordination

2. Two-Phase Commit:
   - Strong consistency
   - Higher latency
   - Not recommended for most cases

## Security

### Q: What are essential security considerations in system design?
**A:** Key areas to address:

1. Authentication/Authorization:
   - Strong identity management
   - Role-based access control
   - Token-based authentication

2. Data Security:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Proper key management

3. Network Security:
   - Proper segmentation
   - Firewall rules
   - DDoS protection

## Cost Optimization

### Q: How do I balance performance and cost?
**A:** Follow these principles:

1. Right-sizing:
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Adjust resources accordingly
   - Use auto-scaling

2. Architecture Choices:
   - Serverless for variable loads
   - Reserved instances for stable loads
   - Spot instances for batch jobs

3. Data Management:
   - Data lifecycle management
   - Storage tiering
   - Caching strategies

## Monitoring and Operations

### Q: What metrics should I monitor in a distributed system?
**A:** Key metrics include:

1. System Metrics:
   - CPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic

2. Application Metrics:
   - Response time
   - Error rates
   - Request rates
   - Queue lengths

3. Business Metrics:
   - Transaction success rate
   - User activity
   - Feature usage
   - Business KPIs

### Q: How do I implement effective logging in a distributed system?
**A:** Best practices:

1. Log Aggregation:
   - Centralized logging
   - Consistent format
   - Correlation IDs

2. Log Levels:
   - ERROR: System failures
   - WARN: Potential issues
   - INFO: Important events
   - DEBUG: Troubleshooting
